# Welcome to Camunda Issues 

❇️ View the official [Camunda public product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/camunda/projects/57).

Our product roadmap is where you can learn about what features we're working on, what stage they're in, and when we expect to bring them to you. Have any questions or comments about items on the roadmap? Share your feedback by leaving a comment on the issue you are interested in.

The issues repository is for communicating Camunda’s roadmap. If you have feedback about the issues repository itself, such as how the issues are presented, let us know through general feedback using the appropriate GitHub issues template.

## Guide to the roadmap
Every item on the roadmap is [an issue](https://github.com/camunda/issues/issues), with a `label` that indicates each of the following:

- A `feature area` that indicates the component of the product to which the item belongs. For a list of current public product components, see below.

- A `target release version`, indicating the version of the product in which we plan to deliver the feature. Camunda has minor releases twice a year, and alpha releases on a monthly basis. Once we know what version we are delivering a feature, we will update the issue to indicate that information. See our [release policy](https://camunda.com/release-policy/) for more information.

- Once a feature is delivered, the `version label` will be applied to the roadmap issue and the issue status will indicate if the feature was delivered in an alpha or minor version.

Some of our features in "Researching" status may still be in the exploratory stages, and have no timeframe available. These are included in the roadmap only for early feedback. 

### Roadmap phases
The [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/camunda/projects/57/views/1) is arranged on a project board to give a sense of how far out each item is on the horizon. Every product or feature is added to a particular project board column according to the development phase in which it is. Be sure to read the disclaimer below since the roadmap is subject to change, especially further out on the timeline. 

#### Researching
We are understanding the problem and researching solutions. In this phase, we are also looking for feedback from users to confirm our hypothesis.

#### In Progress
At this stage, we have understood the problem and we are actively developing a solution.

#### Alpha: Primarily for testing and feedback
Limited availability, requires pre-release agreement. Features still under development, and subject to change. Not recommended for production use, and limited documentation, SLAs or support provided.

#### Minor: Generally available to all customers
Ready for production use with associated SLA and technical support obligations.
