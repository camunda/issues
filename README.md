# Introduction

The Product team has been improving and innovating at a rapid pace. As the Camunda Platform is evolving, new bugs and use-cases emerge. Ideally, we want to keep diligent track of the bugs and feature opportunities we encounter through tickets and internal support requests. This allows easy prioritisation for the product team, as they know which bugs we want resolved and which features we want implemented in the product.

# Creating a Bug or Feature Request

The workflow for submitting a new bug or feature request is as follows.

1. Search camunda/issues and check if there is an existing matching issue.
2a. If there is an existing issue, then add a link to the Jira ticket or mention your use case so that we can continue tracking the impact of the issue. Also ensure to include any relevant information which will help with prioritisation.
2b. If there is no pre-existing issue then:
For a new bug, open an issue in the relevant project using the following templates:
- Feature Request template
- Bug Report template
A Engineer will review the request and, if accepted for work, move the request to the relevant team and trackers.
4. For general guidance on adding comments and required labels for issues, please see [this page].
5. Add the appropriate label to the issue
- If the issue has been identified by support add the label "Support"
- If the issue is impacting a customer's ability to use Camunda platform successfully then add the label "Customer::Impact" and "UX"
- If the issue is impacting the SaaS or Self Managed platform, use the appropriate label "SaaS"/"Self-Managed"
- When possible, specify the application concerned (eg. "Tasklist", "Console", "Optimize", etc) 

6. If you believe a high priority issue is not getting adequate traction then please make your CSM aware of it.
