# Creating a Enhancement or Bug request

The workflow for submitting a new bug or feature request is as follows.

1. Search camunda/issues and check if there is an existing matching issue.
2. If there is an existing issue, then add a link to the Jira ticket or mention your use case so that we can continue tracking the impact of the issue. Also ensure to include any relevant information which will help with prioritisation.
3. If there is no pre-existing issue then open an issue in the relevant project using the following templates:
- Enhancement Request template
- Bug Report template

An Engineer will review the request and, if accepted for work, move the request to the relevant team and trackers.
4. Add the appropriate label to the issue
- If the issue has been identified by support add the label "Support"
- If the issue is impacting a customer's ability to use Camunda platform successfully then add the label "Customer::Impact" and "UX"
- If the issue is impacting the SaaS or Self Managed platform, use the appropriate label "SaaS"/"Self-Managed"
- When possible, specify the application concerned (eg. "Tasklist", "Console", "Optimize", etc) 
5. If you believe a high priority issue is not getting adequate traction then please make your CSM aware of it.
